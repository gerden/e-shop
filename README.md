Description
Allows the user to look through a practice laptop database. The user can scroll through all laptops that are marked as favourites as well as look at the once that aren't. The user can then open the details page where they can add them to their cart.

Creation process
This Application was created by first creating the practice laptop data that I would use. After this I began to create the pages by creating the object that would store a simple version of and array object and then had them shown inside the grid. Once this was done, I then added a button and made sure that it lead to the correct URL before beginning to populate the page with the relevant data. I then populated the database with more Laptops. After some work I was able to create a button that allowed the user to store the item in another database along with the quantity wanted.
After this I checked and corrected any bugs in the code such as it being to add multiple instances of the same object to the cart outside of quantity.

Bugs
Currently no know bugs in the code

Future Improvements
Make the Carousel one thing that slides rather than a picture that is changed by two buttons below it.

Things I Would do differently
Other than populating the full database earlier I wouldn't change the order that I did anything.

Struggles
The main struggle I faced was getting the program to populate the cart database. However, with some help I was able to relies that this was caused by me having two laptop ID values which once I correct allowed be to correctly grab the requested laptop for my laptop database and add it.
